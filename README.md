# PeerTutors

Ellipsis Tech Series 2023 Hackathon

This project won us the Ellipsis Most Innovative Solution for its innovative business model and excellent implementation.

## Our Mission
At the heart of our solution lies a mission to revolutionize the way education is imparted and received. We're not just building a platform; we're shaping a movement. Our goal is to synergize the collective strength of corporations, the expertise of educational institutions, and the passion of students to create a dynamic and impactful learning ecosystem.

We believe that education is not confined to the boundaries of classrooms; it's a collaborative journey that brings together diverse stakeholders, empowering change-makers who have the potential to drive innovation and greatly improve lives.
